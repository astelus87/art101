					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with creating a button that would generate random lorem ipsum text with varying lengths, working off a string of lorem ipsum text. Most of the coding was provided to us, so the real task was mostly to debug if the code provided didn't work.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first, the button wouldn't generate new code, so I mostly tried to use the console log to see if the button itself was working, and if my jquery was linked correctly. Putting in a .click for console.log("click"), I could confirm after pressing the button that the input was registering. After testing rest of the coding, we concluded that the issue was where we placed the code, since some of the code was supposed to go within the other js code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab went quite smoothly, especially since in section the TA walked us through as well, and gave good steps on how to test out each code to see if it was working, and to pinpoint the problem. I think that I need to get a better grip on work process and thinking in a more deducive way so that I can pinpoint issues faster.</p>
