			<h1>Lab X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were tasked to make an array to list out all the methods of transportation we use, and also make an object of our main ride. For the main ride, we were to list out the make, name, color, year, and age of the vehicle.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not many challenges arose, since the task was relatively straightforward. Most of the instructions were given on the Lab 6 instruction page, so what I'm struggling with mostly is making sense of the code that we were given to display our "main ride" object on our website. We were given the code ready made without much explanation, but I'd like to try and decipher to see how it functions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab was completed quite smoothly. There weren't many problems that arose, since the majority of it was done right after the lecture on arrays and objects, so most of the information was still fresh in my mind. I think that I have gotten the basic concept of what arrays and objects are, and how to use them. </p>
