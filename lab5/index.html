					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were given tasks to understan the basics of javascript variables and dataypes. We used the console first in class as a demonstration, which I used for task 1 as the screenshot. We were then asked to apply this in our actual vscode .js file, and define our own cars with the variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The process of this lab was quite smooth, and there weren't many issues that popped up. I was briefly confused why we used the "< br >" at the end while writing in the statements, but when I removed it, all my variables got sorted onto one line on the web page, so I figured out that it was for line breaks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I think that this is quite straight forward so far. The only confusing thing is that there's multiple ways to declare something, like "var" or "let" has the same function. There seems to be a lot of of memorization involved with coding, which isn't my strong suit, so I think it's something that I will have to practice, and grasp with time. </p>
