			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries & jQuery</h1>
			<div id="challenge" class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab was to add a button to each section of the page, and give it a function, like changing the look of the section for example.</p>
	  </div>

		<div id="problems" class="minor-section secondary">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I tried to follow along with the assignment page, and also looked back on what we did in section to help me with coding this assignment. I knew that I would have trouble, so I kept open the jsbin page so I could refer back to it to see what mistakes I may have made, and what I needed to edit in my code.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="reflections" class="minor-section secondary">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I think this assignment was decently challenging. Most of it was spent on debugging, and once that was figured out, I started focusing on making each section's button function a bit more unique by editing what the sections looked like once the buttons were pressed.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="results" class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p class="appear">This lab was quite challenging, but I did my best to try and debug and figure out where I messed up in the coding, and debug until I got the results I wanted. I wanted to try making the words appear only when the button is pressed, but I couldn't figure out how to do that.</p>
