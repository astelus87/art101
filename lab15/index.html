					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were challenged with fetching an API to display on our own site.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled a lot with this lab, since a lot of what ajax & API's were are still quite abstract to me. I was confused about where to input everything, and how to get the results to display.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>For this assignment, I resorted to watching youtube tutorials. The youtube video used the fetch method, and the nice youtube lady put out steps and explained what she was doing as I followed along which was nice and helpful. I was able to comprehend for the most part what she was doing, and what each step was to get to the goal. I was able to follow along with her code, and change it so that it suited what I wanted to do with my own page. I used the yes/no API, so the results look quite simple, but I think that it's doing what I'd like it to.</p>
