			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were assigned to create a callback function and an anon function. We were first told to test out our functions on the console. I made my callback function a multiply by 3, and my anon function was a multiply by 10. Once that worked, I copied that onto my javascript file, and debugged.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was slightly confused on how to make a anon function, but Halei looked over what I may have made mistakes on, and explained how to correct them for me. Anonymous functions were a bit hard for me to grasp, so this lab was a little bit more difficult for me. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I think this lab helped me define more clearly what a callback function was, what an anonymous function was, and how to build both. I definitely think I'll need a little bit more practice to really ingrain the formatting in myself, but this helped me feel more stable. </p>
