					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> In this lab, we were assigned to create and edit our homepage with HTML. We were asked to upload a picture of ourselves, but I'm a bit awful with taking pictures, so I asked if I could upload a drawing I did instead and got permission! We were also assigned to create this page, being an index.html in the Lab 3 folder.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> It is still a slight struggle to try and remember the correct tags for what I'd like to insert into the htmls, as well as what properties were available to customize the CSS. For example, when trying to center the image on my homepage, I struggled a bit, since I didn't remember how I did it for lab 2. I had to look back to see what properties were used, but when i copied that over at first it didn't work. It was an easy fix, since I just had to delete a "margin: 10px" first, since it seemed that took priority first. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall, I think that I still need to practice a bit more while I'm free so that I can ingrain the tags to use in my brain, and how to customize things to my liking using css. It seems that there are quite a few of rules as well as conventions, so I might code some sites from scratch as an experiment to try and memorize things. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> This page is the result of the index.html in the Lab 3 folder, and my file structure folder looks as follows:</p>
