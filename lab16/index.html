					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were challenged to put in a specific API for the comic XKCD onto our website. The end goal was to display the current comic onto our websites.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> For some reason, there was some kind of error that kept displaying on our console. We found out later on that we needed to get a chrome extension called CORS for the output to display properly on our webpage. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I went on a bit of a wild goose chase for this assignment. I tried seeking out a lot of outside sources such as youtube videos for help, but each person seemed to use a different method. My friends and I ended up working on this project together, and after looking back into the lecture videos, we were able to figure it out. </p>
