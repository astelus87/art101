					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were presented with the challenge of taking in a person's name in an input bar, and sorting them into a Hogwarts house after they've typed in their name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not many problems arose for me. The only thing that happened was that I accidentally hit tab while typing, which resulted in me selecting from a menu that popped up automatically in VScode, so I inputted something that I hadn't meant to in my JS code. I used the "console.log("Click")" method to see what was acting up though, and located what wasn't working pretty quickly. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this assignment was quite straightforward, and I think it was easy to accomplish after looking at the instructions and example provided. </p>
