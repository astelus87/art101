			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were asked to first practice pseudocoding by making an ordered list of how to accomplish an everyday task. We decided on psuedocoding putting on makeup, since this was a routine that we both did regularly, so we could work on the list together. After that, we worked on task 3 & 4, where we decided on psuedocoding "Rock Paper Scissors". </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We were a little bit confused about what this lab specifically was asking of us, and what exactly we were expected to do in this class. We did our best to interpret the instructions, and worked together to talk out any confusion we had. For some reason, when pasting the psuedocode into the results section with the "pre" & "code" tag, but it resulted in a huge indent gap, so I made it into an unordered list instead to solve that.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I think we did our best with the new concept introduced. It's a bit of a confusing concept, since we don't see the direct result of anything that we are doing, and it doesn't seem to have any tangible function, only conceptual. Because of this, it was a bit difficult to gauge if we were being specific enough with our list, and if not, what we could add more on without overcomplicating it. </p>
