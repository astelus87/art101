			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were challenged to make loops that assigned each number a word depending on if it were a factor of specified numbers that the user could input themselves. Depending on which number it was a factor of, it would be assigned the word that pertains to that.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab ended up being quite confusing, and I definitely appreciate sections more now. TA's should get paid more. Overall, I think that it's a saving grace that there are examples provided to us for these labs that we can refer to, or else I would still be lost. Overall, this lab was more about decoding the example code to see what was going on, rather than writing some fresh code from scratch myself. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I definitley felt a little bit defeated by this lab, and struggled quite a bit. I ended up just biting the bullet and referring to the example provided, but I think I put in a decent amount of effort to understand why the code works</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					Where should we stop? <input type="number" min=0 max="1000" id="max"><br>
					Which factors should print what? <br>
